High availability techniques
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some scenarios it is important to have some level of robustness and fault 
tolerance. For instance, if a publisher application fails or crashes, we may 
need a mechanism to still continue receiving updates from a backup publisher 
application. To achieve that we have to detect that an application has failed
and start receiving updates from backup publishers with lower priority.
In this example we will learn to:

- Use the Liveliness and Ownership QoS to detect node failures
   and fault tolerance mechanisms.


Running the example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Run the console (Subscriber application)
	./console.py

- Run a primary ./sensor (Publisher application)
	./sensor.py --id 0

- Run a secondary ./sensor (Publisher application)
	./sensor.py --id 0 --secondary

- At this point you will be receiving updates from BOTH the sensors at the same time

- Stop the console and sensor application

- Uncomment the code enclosed within the OWNERSHIP label.

- Re-start the console and sensor applications using the same parameters

- Spot the differences
